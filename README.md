# Zomato_Data_Analysis

Welcome to the Zomota Data Analysis from Kaggle project repository! This project focuses on performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Zomota dataset obtained from Kaggle. The dataset contains information about various restaurants, their menus, customer reviews, and other relevant features. This README file will guide you through the project and provide instructions on how to set up and explore the dataset.

1. Project Overview

The Zomota Data Analysis from Kaggle project aims to gain valuable insights and knowledge from the provided Zomota dataset. By performing exploratory data analysis, we seek to understand various trends, patterns, and correlations in the data, providing a comprehensive understanding of the restaurant industry and customer preferences.

2.Dependencies

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.x
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn

3. Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis can be obtained from Kaggle

4. Exploratory Data Analysis

The core of this project is the exploratory data analysis, where we analyze the dataset to gain insights and discover meaningful patterns. The EDA process involves data cleaning to handle missing values and outliers, followed by data visualization to present the findings effectively.

5. The dataset is later visulaized of all analysis.

6. Data Insights

Based on the results of the exploratory data analysis, document the key findings and insights gained from the dataset. These insights could include popular cuisines, customer preferences, restaurant ratings, and other relevant trends.

7. Contributing

Contributions to improve the data analysis and discover additional insights are welcome. If you have any suggestions or new ideas, feel free to submit a pull request. Follow the standard coding conventions and provide clear documentation for your contributions.
